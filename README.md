## General info
The main purpose of the application is to test different ways of logging into the Flutter application. I focused mainly on the implementation of the login itself, so I didn't pay that much attention to the fancy UI and the error handling is rather basic. On the initial screen of the app, you can choose one of nine ways to log in. After successful verification, the user is taken to a simple SuccessScreen where he can log out or delete the account.
